This codes are for securing your folders by Encrypting and Decrypting.

I will use Visual Studio code for the implementation.
I will use AES-256 encryption in Python.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a powerful algorithm used 
by governments and security experts alike. 
We will use a 256-bit key for encryption 
and this key will must be required for decryption. 
It will add extra strength to our encryption process.
Encryption is a great way to protect information.


Requirements:
To run the programs, you’ll need Python 3 
and
the pyzipper library installed:

"pip install pyzipper"


Steps:
1.Create a new Python file (e.g., encrypt_folder.py) using your favorite code editor.
2.Copy and paste the following code into the file.
3.Replace the placeholders with your desired values:
	3.1)input_folder: Path to the folder you want to encrypt.
	3.2)output_file: Path and name for the encrypted zip file (e.g., encrypted_folder.zip).
	3.3)password: 32 bytes (256-bit) long encryption password (You can use this sample password for a demo: ‘OcIuSk8dGjHEzNYtmo4pqZDQBFsP3rlU’).




Encrypting a folder:

import os
import pyzipper
def encrypt_folder(input_folder, output_file, password):
    with pyzipper.AESZipFile(output_file, 'w', compression=pyzipper.ZIP_LZMA) as zf:
        zf.setpassword(password.encode('utf-8'))
        zf.setencryption(pyzipper.WZ_AES, nbits=256)
        
        for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(input_folder):
            for filename in filenames:
                file_path = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
                arcname = os.path.relpath(file_path, input_folder)
                zf.write(file_path, arcname=arcname)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_folder = 'Folder_Path'
    output_file = 'encrypted_folder.zip'
    # Password must be 32 bytes (256-bit) long
    password = 'Your_Password_Here'
    encrypt_folder(input_folder, output_file, password)
    print(f"Folder '{input_folder}' has been encrypted as '{output_file}'")




Decrypting the Encrypted Zip File:

import pyzipper
def decrypt_zip(input_file, output_folder, password):
    with pyzipper.AESZipFile(input_file) as zf:
        zf.setpassword(password.encode('utf-8'))
        zf.extractall(path=output_folder)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = 'encrypted.zip'
    output_folder = 'decrypted_folder'
    password = 'Your_Password_Here'

    decrypt_zip(input_file, output_folder, password)
    print(f"{input_file} has been decrypted into folder '{output_folder}'")
